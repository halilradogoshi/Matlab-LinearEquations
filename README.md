# Matlab - Linear Equations
Pragmatic examples on how to solve simultaneous linear equations with Matlab. The project includes methods for graphical, symbolic and numeric solutions to simultaneous linear equations.

The user will have to input six constants (a1,b1,a2,b2,c1,c2) for the simulatneous linear equations:

**a1x + b1y = c1  
a2x + b2y = c2**

Here is an example on how to identify the constants:

5x + 4y = 7  
3x - y = 11

a1 = 5, b1 = 4, a2 = 3, b2 = -1  
c1 = 7, c2 = 11
